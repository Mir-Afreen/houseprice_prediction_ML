This project is an end-to-end machine learning application that predicts house prices based on property features.
It covers the complete workflow from model development to deployment with an API and an interactive web interface.
Built the Machine Learning Model
--Used Python and Scikit-learn to analyze housing data
--Performed data cleaning, feature selection, and preprocessing
--Trained and evaluated regression models to achieve accurate predictions
--Saved the final trained model for later use

Created a REST API
--Developed an API using FastAPI
--Loaded the trained ML model to serve real-time predictions
--Designed endpoints to accept user input and return predicted prices
--Tested the API for performance and reliability

Developed a Frontend Interface
--Built an interactive UI with Streamlit
--Users can enter house details through a simple form
--The app sends data to the FastAPI backend and displays the predicted price instantly

Technologies I Used
--Python
--Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
--FastAPI (Backend API)
--Streamlit (Frontend UI)
--Pandas & NumPy (Data Processing)
